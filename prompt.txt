# SHADOW INSURE BOT: Prompting Strategy

**Objective:** To simulate a conversational voice AI assistant for insurance queries.

**Current Logic (as implemented in getBotResponse function):**
The bot processes user input by converting it to lowercase and checking for the presence of specific keywords.

**Keyword-Response Mapping:**
- "hello", "hi": "Hello there! How can I help you with your insurance needs today?"
- "policy": "Are you looking for information on life insurance, health insurance, or general insurance policies?"
- "claim": "To assist with claims, please tell me the type of insurance and your policy number."
- "health insurance": "Health insurance policies cover medical expenses. Do you want to know about coverage, premiums, or claims process?"
- "life insurance": "Life insurance provides financial security for your loved ones. What specific information are you looking for?"
- "quote", "price": "I can help you with a quote. What type of insurance are you interested in?"
- "thank you", "thanks": "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
- "bye", "goodbye": "Goodbye! Have a great day. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions."

**Fallback Response:**
- If no keyword is matched: "I'm sorry, I don't have information on that specific query yet. Can you please rephrase or ask about common insurance topics?"

**Future Considerations for LLM Integration:**
If integrating a large language model, the prompt would evolve to include:
- A detailed persona description for the bot (e.g., "You are a helpful, empathetic, and knowledgeable insurance agent from ValuEnable...").
- Instructions on how to utilize an external knowledge base for factual answers (RAG).
- Guidelines for handling sensitive information and maintaining conversational context.
- Examples of desired conversational turns for complex scenarios.
